# Diabetes_Prediction_Model
This code is from a project I made for a college class. The code uses open-source medical data to train a model to read that data and predict the weather a person would develope diabetes. 

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LouaiAlJabi/Diabetes_Prediction_Model.git
cd Bootstrap

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Project Questions
* Can the model predict predict the likelyhood a person would develope diabetes?
* What are the most important medical features to indicate this likelyhood?
